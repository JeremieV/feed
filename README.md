# Progressive feed

A simple hacker news clone except it gets progressively more complicated.

Can be found here: https://progressive-feed.vercel.app

I captured the first few iterations as just to show my process ^[And to kind of motivate me to have no "zero days"]. It's not worth much in the end because there were many more very slow or broken along the way than I expected:
- https://progressive-feed-1.vercel.app very first draft, titles and links
- https://progressive-feed-2.vercel.app added an alternative grid view
- https://progressive-feed-3.vercel.app added the option to choose the feed (hacker news / dev.to / RSS feed (draft))
- https://progressive-feed-4.vercel.app fixed RSS fetching (using RSS2JSON free tier, limited to 10.000 requests/day) and enabled users to read any RSS feed they like. Stories sorted by date published, which has its drawbacks.
